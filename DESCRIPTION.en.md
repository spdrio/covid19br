## `epi_week` column

This column corresponds to the number of the epidemiological week. The values range from 1 to 53 in 2020, and from 101 to 152 in 2021. The first digit (1, for example) is used to indicate that this corresponds to the year 2021, instead of 2020. To obtain the respective epidemiological week, please use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation). For example, using Python:

```python
epidemiological_week = 152 % 100 # = 52
```

The date intervals are defined by the Ministério da Saúde in their Epidemiological Calendar:

- 2020: http://portalsinan.saude.gov.br/calendario-epidemiologico-2020
- 2021: http://www.portalsinan.saude.gov.br/calendario-epidemiologico

## Dataset files of COVID-19 in Brazil

These are the main files of the dataset. The files `cases-brazil-states.csv` and `cases-brazil-total.csv` have data only at the federative units level. The files `cases-brazil-cities*.csv` have data at the municipality level.

All values by 100k inhabitants are evaluated dividing the number by population and multiplying by 10⁵; see `cities_info.csv`.

### By federative units: `cases-brazil-total.csv` and `cases-brazil-states.csv`

Both files share column names. The complete timeline is available at `cases-brazil-states.csv`, while `cases-brazil-total.csv` has only numbers for the last day.

### By municipalities: `cases-brazil-cities.csv`, `cases-brazil-cities-time.csv.gz` and `cases-brazil-cities-time_changesOnly.csv`

All files share column names. `epi_week` is not available in `cases-brazil-cities.csv`. The columns `cod_RegiaoDeSaude` and `name_RegiaoDeSaude` are not shown in `cases-brazil-cities-time.csv.gz` and `cases-brazil-cities-time_changesOnly.csv`.

The full timeline is available in `cases-brazil-cities-time.csv.gz` (with gzip compression), and data for the last day in `cases-brazil-cities.csv`. The file `cases-brazil-cities-time_changesOnly.csv` is a subset of `cases-brazil-cities-time.csv`, where `newCases` and/or `newDeaths` are non zero.
